# Hi this is my third work: a Tic Tac Toe game and my first time coding a Javascript file

# Project Content
- morpion.html – The game page
- morpion.css – CSS styling for layout and visuals
- morpion.js – My first JavaScript file to handle game logic

# What it includes:
- A 3x3 grid for Tic Tac Toe
- Players take turns (Blue and Red)
- Win conditions and draw detection
- Styled with CSS for a better look

# Tech Used
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript (first time using JS!)
